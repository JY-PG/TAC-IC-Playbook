## Writing Style

### Grammar and Punctuation

**Sentence structure**
- Aim for 15-20 words per sentence
- Use active voice (80%+ of sentences)
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Start sentences with action words when possible

**Punctuation**
- **Oxford comma:** Use it (red, white, and blue)
- **Apostrophes:** It's = it is, its = possessive
- **Quotation marks:** Use double quotes "like this"
- **Hyphens:** Use for compound adjectives (well-known fact)

**Capitalisation**
- **Sentence case:** for headings and titles
- **Title case:** only for formal document titles
- **Job titles:** Capitalise when before name (Manager Sarah Smith)
- **Departments:** Transport Accident Commission, Claims Division

### Numbers and Dates

**Numbers**
- Spell out one to nine, use numerals for 10+
- Use numerals for ages, percentages, measurements
- Start of sentence: always spell out (Twenty people attended)
- Large numbers: 1.2 million, $3.5 billion

**Dates and times**
- **Date format:** 15 March 2024 (no commas)
- **Short dates:** 15/3/24 or 15 Mar 2024
- **Time format:** 9am, 2:30pm, 9:30am-5pm
- **Days:** Monday, Tuesday (always spell out)

**Money**
- **Amounts:** $500, $1200, $1.2 million
- **Ranges:** $50-100 or $50 to $100
- **Budgets:** Always include GST status if relevant

### Abbreviations and Acronyms

**General rule:** Spell out on first use, then abbreviate
*Example: Transport Accident Commission (TAC) provides support. TAC also works on prevention.*

**Common TAC abbreviations**
- CEO: Chief Executive Officer
- ELT: Executive Leadership Team
- GM: General Manager
- IC: Internal Communications
- P&C: People & Culture
- IT: Information Technology

**Avoid unnecessary abbreviations**
- Don't abbreviate: application (app), information (info)
- Be careful with: etc. (use "and others" or be specific)

**Units and measurements**
- Use metric: kilometres (km), metres (m), litres (L)
- Time: hours, minutes, seconds (not hrs, mins, secs)
