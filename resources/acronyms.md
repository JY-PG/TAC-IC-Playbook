## Usage guidelines

### When to use acronyms

**✅ Appropriate:**
- After first use with full term
- In informal communications where widely understood
- Technical documentation for expert audiences
- Space-constrained formats (presentations, forms)

**❌ Avoid:**
- First use without explanation
- External communications
- All-staff emails to diverse audiences
- When full term is clearer

### Best practices

**First use rule**
Always spell out acronyms on first use:
*"The Executive Leadership Team (ELT) meets weekly. ELT decisions are communicated through..."*

**Know your audience**
- **Internal experts:** Can use common acronyms freely
- **New staff:** Need more explanation
- **All-staff:** Use sparingly and explain
- **External:** Avoid internal acronyms

**When in doubt, spell it out**
If you're unsure whether your audience knows an acronym, use the full term.

## Common mistakes

### Overuse of acronyms

❌ **Too many acronyms:**
"The PMO's BIA shows our CRM ROI exceeds KPIs for Q3 FY24."

✅ **Clear communication:**
"The Project Management Office's analysis shows our client system returns exceed targets for this quarter."

### Inconsistent usage

❌ **Inconsistent:**
"ELT approved the P&C strategy. The Executive Leadership Team will review people and culture metrics monthly."

✅ **Consistent:**
"The Executive Leadership Team (ELT) approved the People & Culture strategy. ELT will review metrics monthly."

### Assuming knowledge

❌ **Assumption:**
"All HRIS data must be updated in the CMS before EOD."

✅ **Clear:**
"All staff information must be updated in the claims system by end of day."
