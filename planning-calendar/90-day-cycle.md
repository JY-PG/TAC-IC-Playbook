## Success tips

### What works well

✅ **Submit early and complete**  
The more complete your submission, the better we can help

✅ **Be realistic**  
Better to do fewer things well than many things poorly

✅ **Think audience-first**  
What do they need, when do they need it?

✅ **Collaborate with others**  
Find opportunities to combine messages

✅ **Stay flexible**  
Things change - build in buffer time

### Common mistakes

❌ **Leaving it too late**  
Last-minute requests get lowest priority

❌ **Requesting everything**  
Focus on what really matters

❌ **Inflexible timing**  
Sometimes moving a week makes huge difference

❌ **Forgetting measurement**  
Plan how you'll measure from the start

Talk to other teams about shared needs
