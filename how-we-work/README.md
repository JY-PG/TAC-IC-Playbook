# How We Work

## Partnering with you for effective communication

This section explains how the Internal Communications team operates, our service model, and how we work with teams across TAC to deliver effective communications.

---

## Our approach

### From push to pull
We're transforming how TAC communicates internally:
- **Moving from** broadcasting everything to everyone  
- **Moving to** targeted, relevant communications
- **Result**: People get the information they need, when they need it

### Partnership model
We work best when we're:
- **Involved early** in your planning
- **Clear on objectives** and success measures
- **Collaborative** in our approach
- **Focused on outcomes** not just outputs
