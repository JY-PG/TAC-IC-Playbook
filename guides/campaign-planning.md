# Campaign Planning Guide

## Orchestrating multi-channel communications for maximum impact

A communication campaign is a coordinated series of messages across multiple channels, designed to achieve specific objectives over time. This guide walks you through planning and executing successful campaigns at TAC.

## What makes a campaign?

### Campaign characteristics
