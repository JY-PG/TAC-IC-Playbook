# Writing Effective All-Staff Emails

## Emails that cut through and create impact

All-staff emails are powerful but should be used sparingly. When you need to reach everyone at TAC, this guide helps you write emails that get opened, read, and acted upon.

---

## When to use all-staff email

### Good reasons ‚úÖ
- Critical updates affecting everyone
- Major organisational announcements
- Safety or compliance requirements
- CEO/ELT messages
- Emergency communications

### Poor reasons ‚ùå
- Team-specific information
- Optional events
- General FYI updates
- Personal announcements
- External promotions

{% hint style="info" %}
**Rule of thumb:** If less than 80% of staff need this information, use targeted channels instead.
{% endhint %}

---

## The 300-word rule

### Why 300 words?
Our data shows:
- Read time: Under 90 seconds
- Completion rate: 85%+ for short emails
- Action rate: 3x higher than long emails
- Mobile-friendly: Fits one screen

### Word count breakdown

{% hint style="info" %}
- Subject line: 6-8 words
- Opening: 50 words
- Body: 200 words
- Call-to-action: 50 words
- **Total: 300 words maximum**
{% endhint %}

## Email structure template

### Subject line formula

**[Action Required] Topic - Deadline**
*Example: [Action Required] Annual leave planning - Complete by March 15*

**[Important Update] Topic**
*Example: [Important Update] New parking arrangements from Monday*

**[For Your Information] Topic**
*Example: [For Your Information] CEO Town Hall recording available*

## Writing techniques

### Lead with the key message

‚ùå **Wrong way:**
"As you may be aware, over the past several months we have been reviewing our systems and processes..."

‚úÖ **Right way:**
"From Monday 1 April, we're launching a new expense system that's faster and easier to use."

### Use the inverted pyramid

1. **Most important** information first
2. **Supporting** details next
3. **Background** if needed last

### Make it scannable

**Use:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for key points
- Subheadings for sections
- White space for breathing room

**Avoid:**
- Walls of text
- Long sentences (over 20 words)
- Multiple topics
- Buried key messages
- Jargon or acronyms

---

## Subject line best practices

### Effective subject lines

‚úÖ **Clear and specific**
- "New leave system launches Monday"
- "Parking changes from 1 March"
- "Your action needed: IT security update"

‚úÖ **Create urgency (when real)**
- "48 hours left: Submit your preferences"
- "Today only: CEO live Q&A at 2pm"
- "Urgent: Building evacuation drill at 11am"

‚úÖ **Indicate action required**
- "[Response needed] Team survey closes Friday"
- "[Please read] Important policy update"
- "[Register now] Leadership workshop"

### Subject lines to avoid

‚ùå **Vague or generic**
- "Update"
- "Important information"
- "Please read"

‚ùå **Too long**
- "Information about the new system implementation and training sessions happening next month"

‚ùå **Misleading**
- "URGENT!!!" (when it's not)
- "You've won!" (for routine updates)
