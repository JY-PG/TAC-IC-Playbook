## Plain English principles

### 1. Use everyday words

{% hint style="info" %}
❌ **Jargon/Complex**
- utilise → use
- facilitate → help
- commence → start
- in order to → to
- prior to → before

✅ **Plain/Simple**
- assistance → help
- approximately → about
- sufficient → enough
- endeavour → try
- regarding → about
{% endhint %}

### 2. Keep sentences short

{% hint style="success" %}
**Aim for:** 15-20 words per sentence
{% endhint %}

❌ **Too long (35 words):**
"In accordance with the policy that was recently implemented by the Executive Leadership Team, all staff members are required to complete the mandatory training module by the specified deadline."

✅ **Just right (19 words):**
"All staff must complete the new mandatory training by [date]. This policy was recently approved by the Executive Team."

### 3. Use active voice

**Active voice** = Subject does the action  
**Passive voice** = Action is done to the subject

❌ **Passive:**
- "Mistakes were made"
- "The report will be reviewed"
- "Questions can be asked"

✅ **Active:**
- "We made mistakes"
- "Sarah will review the report"
- "You can ask questions"

### 4. Be specific and concrete

❌ **Vague:**
- "In the near future"
- "A number of people"
- "Significant improvements"

✅ **Specific:**
- "By March 15"
- "25 people"
- "30% faster processing"

---

## Structure for clarity

### Use the inverted pyramid

**Most important information first**
- Lead with the key message
- Follow with supporting details
- End with background (if needed)

### Organize with headings

**Use descriptive headings:**
- ✅ "How to claim expenses"
- ❌ "Process overview"

**Make them parallel:**
- ✅ "Planning your leave"
- ✅ "Booking your leave"
- ✅ "Changing your leave"

### Chunk information

**Break up long text with:**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bullet points for lists
- Numbers for steps
- White space for breathing room

---

## Writing techniques

### Start with the action

❌ **Buried action:**
"Due to the implementation of the new system, it will be necessary for all users to update their passwords."

✅ **Action first:**
"Update your password before March 1. The new system requires stronger security."

### Use parallel structure

❌ **Not parallel:**
- Save documents
- Backing up files
- To check your work

✅ **Parallel:**
- Save documents
- Back up files
- Check your work

### Choose positive language

❌ **Negative focus:**
"You cannot access the system until you complete training."

✅ **Positive focus:**
"Complete training to access the system."

---

## Common word swaps

### Replace bureaucratic language

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| advise | tell, inform |
| as per | according to |
| at this point in time | now |
| due to the fact that | because |
| in the event that | if |
| please be advised | (delete) |
| pursuant to | under |
| with regard to | about |

### Replace technical jargon

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| interface | connect, work together |
| leverage | use |
| optimise | improve |
| parameters | limits |
| robust | strong |
| streamline | simplify |
| synthesise | combine |
| utilisation | use |

## TAC-specific guidance

### Avoid internal jargon

❌ **Internal speak:**
- "ELT has endorsed"

- "Going forward"
- "Touch base"
- "Circle back"

✅ **Plain alternative:**
- "Leadership has approved"
- "The proposal"
- "From now on"
- "Meet"
- "Follow up"

### Explain necessary acronyms

**First use:** Full term (acronym)  
**Later uses:** Acronym only

✅ **Example:**
"Transport Accident Commission (TAC) helps injured people. TAC also works to prevent road trauma."

### Use Australian spelling

### The friend test

Ask someone to:

### The out-loud test

Read your writing aloud:

## Email-specific tips

### Subject lines

❌ **Vague:** "Important information"  
✅ **Specific:** "New parking rules start Monday"

### Opening lines

❌ **Wordy:** "I hope this email finds you well..."  
✅ **Direct:** "The staff survey closes this Friday."

### Closing lines

✅ **Friendly:** "Questions? Email me or call xxxx."

## Common mistakes

### Information overload

{% hint style="warning" %}
❌ **Too much:**
Trying to cover everything in one document

✅ **Just enough:**
Key information with links to detail
{% endhint %}

### Assuming knowledge

❌ **Assumptions:**
"As discussed in the ELT meeting..."

✅ **Clear context:**
"At last week's leadership meeting, we decided..."

### Buried lead

❌ **Background first:**
"Following extensive consultation and analysis of various options..."

✅ **Key message first:**
"We're introducing flexible working hours from April 1."
