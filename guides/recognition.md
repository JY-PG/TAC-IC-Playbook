## Recognition framework

### The STAR method

{% hint style="info" %}
**Situation:** What was the context?  
**Task:** What needed to be done?  
**Action:** What did they do?
{% endhint %}  
**Result:** What was the outcome?

✅ **Example using STAR:**
"When our client system crashed last Friday (Situation), Sarah needed to process 200 urgent claims manually (Task). She stayed late, coordinated with IT, and created a backup process (Action). All claims were processed on time and no clients were disadvantaged (Result)."

### The 5 W's approach

**Who:** Person/team being recognised  
**What:** Achievement or behaviour  
**When:** Timeframe or specific date  
**Where:** Context or location  
**Why:** Impact and significance

✅ **Example using 5 W's:**
"Michael from Claims (Who) developed a new client tracking system (What) over the past three months (When) working with IT and Customer Service (Where) that has reduced client waiting time by 40% (Why)."

## Making it meaningful

### Personalisation matters

**Know the person:**
- Communication preferences
- Values and motivations
- Career aspirations
- Personal circumstances

**Tailor the recognition:**
- Public vs private preference
- Individual vs team focus
- Formal vs informal style
- Immediate vs planned

### Timing is critical

**Immediate recognition** (same day)

- Client feedback
- Peer appreciation

**Planned recognition** (within week)
- Project completion
- Award ceremonies
- Newsletter features
- Team celebrations

**Milestone recognition** (scheduled)

### Make it proportional

**Match effort to recognition:**
- Small contribution = thank you note
- Good work = team recognition
- Exceptional effort = public recognition
- Outstanding achievement = formal award

**Avoid recognition inflation:**
- Don't over-recognise routine work
- Save big recognition for big achievements
- Maintain meaning and value
- Keep standards high
