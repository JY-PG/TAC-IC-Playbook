# Change Communications

## Leading people through change with clear, compassionate communication

Change is constant at TAC, whether it's new systems, processes, structures, or ways of working. How we communicate change determines whether people embrace it or resist it. This guide helps you communicate change in ways that build understanding, reduce anxiety, and drive adoption.

***

## Understanding change communication

### Why change communication is different

**Change is emotional**

* People fear loss
* Uncertainty creates anxiety
* Trust becomes crucial
* Relationships matter more

**Change requires more**

* Multiple touchpoints
* Two-way dialogue
* Ongoing support
* Sustained effort

**Change takes time**

* Awareness phase
* Understanding phase
* Acceptance phase
* Adoption phase

### Common change reactions

**Initial response (first 24-48 hours)**

* Shock or surprise
* Denial or disbelief
* Information seeking
* Emotional reactions

**Processing phase (first weeks)**

* Question everything
* Seek clarification
* Express concerns
* Look for support

**Adaptation phase (ongoing)**

* Try new approaches
* Learn new skills
* Adjust behaviours
* Find new normal

***

## Change communication principles

### 1. Lead with why

People need to understand:

* Why change is necessary
* What happens if we don't change
* How this helps TAC's mission
* What's in it for them personally

✅ **Good why statement:** "We're updating our client system because the current one is 15 years old, increasingly unreliable, and prevents us from serving clients as effectively as they deserve."

❌ **Poor why statement:** "Management has decided to implement a new system."

### 2. Be transparent and honest

**Share what you know**

* Current situation honestly
* Future state clearly
* Timeline realistically
* Challenges openly

**Acknowledge what you don't know**

* "We're still working out..."
* "That decision hasn't been made yet..."
* "I'll find out and get back to you..."
* "We'll know more by..."

### 3. Address the emotional side

**Acknowledge feelings**

* "I understand this feels overwhelming..."
* "It's natural to feel uncertain..."
* "Your concerns are valid..."
* "Change is never easy..."

**Provide reassurance**

* Support available
* Training provided
* Gradual implementation
* Success factors in place

### 4. Communicate frequently

**Rule of 7:** People need to hear a message 7 times in 7 different ways before they truly understand it.

**Frequency guidelines:**

* Major change: Weekly updates minimum
* System change: Multiple touchpoints
* Ongoing change: Regular check-ins
* Crisis change: Daily communication
