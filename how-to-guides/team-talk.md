# Team Talk Toolkit

## Bringing organisational messages to life for your team

Team Talks are TAC's way of cascading important information through the organisation. As a leader, you're the crucial link between organisational messages and what they mean for your team. This guide helps you deliver Team Talks that engage, inform, and inspire.

***

## What is a Team Talk?

### Definition

A Team Talk is a structured briefing where managers:

* Share key organisational messages
* Provide team-specific context
* Facilitate discussion
* Gather feedback
* Drive action

### When they happen

* **Regular**: Fortnightly team meetings
* **Special**: Major announcements
* **Urgent**: Time-sensitive updates

### Why they matter

* Messages reach everyone consistently
* Teams get localised context
* Two-way dialogue happens
* Feedback flows upward
* Change gets embedded

***

## The 3-slide maximum rule

### Why only 3 slides?

Our research shows:

* **Attention span**: 10-15 minutes optimal
* **Retention**: 3 key messages maximum
* **Discussion time**: More slides = less dialogue
* **Manager confidence**: Easier to present
* **Consistency**: Same core messages org-wide

### Slide breakdown

**Slide 1: The What**

* Key message/announcement
* Essential facts
* Timeline

**Slide 2: The Why**

* Business rationale
* Benefits
* Connection to strategy

**Slide 3: The How**

* What it means for us
* Actions required
* Where to get help

When you receive the toolkit:

* Read through all materials

## Delivery best practices

### Opening strong

✅ **Good opening:** "I want to share some important news about our new customer system. This directly affects how we'll work from next month, and I'm excited about the improvements it brings."

❌ **Weak opening:** "So, um, I've got some slides from Internal Comms to go through..."

### The 10-10 rule

**10 minutes presenting**

* Slide 1: 3 minutes
* Slide 2: 3 minutes
* Slide 3: 4 minutes

**10 minutes discussing**

* Questions: 5 minutes
* Implications: 3 minutes
* Actions: 2 minutes

### Creating engagement

**Do:**

* Make eye contact
* Use people's names
* Share your perspective
* Invite questions
* Acknowledge concerns

**Don't:**

* Just read the slides
* Rush through
* Dismiss concerns
* Skip discussion
* Wing it
