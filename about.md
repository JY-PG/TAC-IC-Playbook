# About this prototype

## About This Prototype

This playbook prototype represents a key component of TAC's Internal Communications transformation. It's designed to demonstrate how we can shift from reactive, push-based communications to a proactive, pull-based model that empowers staff and reduces information overload.

***

## Strategic Context

### The Challenge

TAC's internal communications are at a critical juncture. Our research revealed:

* **Information overload** - Staff feel overwhelmed by the volume of communications
* **Unclear priorities** - Everything feels urgent, making nothing feel important
* **Channel confusion** - Multiple channels with overlapping purposes
* **Limited self-service** - Dependency on Internal Comms for routine tasks
* **Measurement gaps** - Difficulty demonstrating communication effectiveness

### Our Strategic Response

The Internal Communications Strategy proposes four fundamental shifts:

| From             | To               | What This Means                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Push**         | **Pull**         | Information available when needed, not just when sent |
| **Broadcasting** | **Targeting**    | Right message, right audience, right time             |
| **Reactive**     | **Proactive**    | Aligned with 90-day planning cycles                   |
| **Inconsistent** | **Standardised** | Clear processes while maintaining flexibility         |

## Purpose of This Playbook

### What It Is

The playbook is a digital self-service resource that:

* **Clarifies** how Internal Communications works
* **Empowers** teams to handle routine communications independently
* **Standardises** approaches while maintaining flexibility
* **Connects** communication efforts to strategic outcomes

### What It Demonstrates

This prototype shows how we can:

1. **Make the service visible** - Clear explanation of how IC works and how to engage
2. **Enable self-service** - Templates, guides, and tools for common tasks
3. **Reduce friction** - Streamlined processes and clear timelines
4. **Build capability** - Practical guidance that upskills the organisation
5. **Create consistency** - Standardised approaches that improve quality

### Who It's For

* **Communication creators** - Anyone who needs to communicate
* **People leaders** - Those who cascade information to teams
* **Communications Champions** - Network members supporting their areas
* **Internal Comms team** - Clear framework for consistent service

***

## Design Principles

The playbook embodies key principles:

1. **User-centred** - Organised around user needs, not IC structure
2. **Action-oriented** - Focus on helping people do things
3. **Plain English** - No jargon, clear explanations
4. **Mobile-friendly** - Accessible anywhere, anytime
5. **Living resource** - Regularly updated and improved

***

## Success Measures

We'll know the playbook is successful when:

* âœ“ Reduction in routine IC queries
* âœ“ Increased communication quality scores
* âœ“ Higher user satisfaction ratings
* âœ“ More time for IC strategic work
* âœ“ Better alignment with TAC priorities

***

## Next Steps

1. **Review prototype** - Gather feedback on content and structure
2. **Test with users** - Validate with different audience groups
3. **Refine content** - Incorporate feedback and improvements
4. **Plan rollout** - Develop implementation and adoption approach
5. **Measure impact** - Track usage and effectiveness
